# Mock up store
This was a quick mock up for a English assignment we made a fake
business, with a fake store. We needed to create a business and give
an example of what we do. I went ahead and created a quick store with
inventory and login. 

### Notes
Built with Sinatra
Not db backed

### Running

Use bundler to get the dependancies
```bash
bundler install
```

Then run app.rb to start the server
```bash
ruby app.rb
```
